# DockPong
A cool little pong game that can be played from the dock. Saw on twitter by [@neilsardesai](https://twitter.com/neilsardesai/status/1362890469970214917). I did not know about the NSDockTile API. People were asking in the comments for the source and he did not post it so I figured I'd try and hack my way through it. Not sure how Neil adjusted the difficulty of CPU paddle mine is still a little dumb
